## SwiftNews
SwiftNews is an open-source iOS application designed to aggregate news articles, provide concise summaries, and tailor content based on individual user interests. Built using Python (FastAPI) for the backend and Swift for the iOS interface, SwiftNews offers a seamless experience to stay updated with what's happening around you.

## Technologies in use
On backend we used Python language and its libraries: FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Selenium, newspaper3k.

And on frontend to develop an iOS app we decided to use: Swift, AVKit, Charts, SwiftUI and SwiftData.

## Team members
The project was a collaborative effort between two developers, both focusing on the idea and its execution. This allowed for a seamless blend of creativity and technical expertise, resulting in a successful outcome.

## The idea behind the app
We created this application because there was no similar one on the market. It weighs only 11MB yet encompasses all essential features. The app allows for personalized news delivery while prioritizing user privacy, as all user data remains stored on their device. Our motivation stemmed from the absence of such an app and our own need for it. This drove us to develop the application in the best way possible with a focus on efficiency and user privacy. We are also open to any suggestions from users and invite them to reach out to us for feedback and ideas. Additionally, we believe in empowering users by providing the option to host their own backend server at home for complete privacy. Soon, a Dockerfile will be added to the project to facilitate this process. Your active participation is key to shaping the app's future. Thank you for your support!
